# Account Management API

This is a simple RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, which allows you to post and retrieve account data. The API has two endpoints: one for posting account data and another for retrieving it. The app uses `dotenv` for managing environment variables, and connects to MongoDB to store and retrieve data.
